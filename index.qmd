## Child Poverty
![](childP.jpeg)
 
 **Child Poverty** is a significant social issue that is affecting millions of children worldwide due to the *economic*, *social*, and *environmental* factors. The consequences of child poverty can be devastating,
including:

 - malnutrition
 - poor health
 - lack of education and 
 - limited opportunities for a better future.
 
 For better understanding, the world map and the bar chart visualisations will be used.

## Population Explosion
![](popExp.jpeg)


The world population has grown exponentially in recent decades, a phenomenon often referred to as the **population explosion**. This growth has significant implications for a range of issues, from *climate change* and *food security* to urbanization and economic development.
To better understand this trend, we can use a time series plot to visualize the world population over time in the same quarto report.

In this quarto report, I will raise awareness on child poverty and population explosion wherein I will analyze the data, gain insights and explore the extent of child poverty and population expansion globally using four R visualizations:

 1. World map
 2. Bar chart
 3. Scatter plot with linear regression
 4. Time-series chart

## Data

To create the child poverty visualizations, I will use data from one of the data file, unicef_indicator_1.csv from the
**UNICEF** database and therein is included a specific indicator- "Percentage Children suffering exactly five deprivations. Homogeneous moderate standards" which measures how many children suffer at least five deprivations using homogenous standards and moderate thresholds. For more information
about this indicator: 
<https://data.unicef.org/indicator-profile/PV_CHLD_DPRV-E5-HS/>

To create the scatter plot visualisation, one more data file, unicef_metadata.csv from the World Development Indicators by the **World Bank** (<https://databank.worldbank.org/source/worlddevelopment-indicators>) will also be used alongwith the indicator file. 

And to create the population explosion visualisation of time series, I will be using only unicef_metadata.csv from the World Development Indicators by the **World Bank**.



```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
unicef_indicator_1<- read_csv("/cloud/project/unicef_indicator_1.csv")
unicef_metadata<- read_csv("/cloud/project/unicef_metadata.csv")
```

# World Map Visualization: Global Child Poverty Rates from 2011 to 2018
Children experience poverty differently from adults as they have unique needs to survive and thrive. Their dreams and hopes are different, and they rely on adults to support and take care of their necessities, rather than having to earn a living themselves. Therefore, when assessing child poverty, it is crucial to use a direct multidimensional measurement that considers various dimensions, such as clothing, education, health, housing, information, nutrition, play, sanitation, and water, which are all essential rights that constitute poverty.

The below world map visualisation shows the percentage of children suffering exactly five deprivations such as education, health, housing, nutrition, sanitation, and water based on comparable standards and moderate thresholds between the years 2011 and 2018. ***Africa*** continent has highest rates of children living in poverty. ***Madagascar*** is the country with highest proportion of children suffering from exactly five deprivations.

```{r}
world_map <- map_data("world") 
map_unicef_indicator_1 <- full_join(world_map, unicef_indicator_1, by = c("region" = "country"))
world_map_plot <-ggplot(data = map_unicef_indicator_1) +
  aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = obs_value) +
  geom_polygon() +
scale_fill_gradient(low = "green", high = "red", na.value = "grey") +
  labs(
    title = "Percentage of Children suffering exactly five deprivations (2011 to 2018)",
    subtitle = "Countries in grey have no data ",
    caption = "Source: R package {unicef_indicator_1}",
    x = "Longitude",
    y = "Latitude",
    fill = "Obs_Value"
  ) +
 theme_linedraw()

print(world_map_plot)
```

# Bar Chart: Poverty Rates Over Time(2011 to 2018)
The second visualization of a bar chart shows how the child poverty rates have changed globally from 2011 to 2018. As per the bar chart plot, the year ***2018*** had the maximum sum of observed poverty values whereas the year ***2013*** had the minimum sum of observed poverty values.
```{r}
unicef_data_by_year <- unicef_indicator_1 %>% 
  group_by(time_period) %>% 
  summarise(Values = sum(obs_value))
bar_chart_plot <- ggplot(data = unicef_data_by_year) +
  aes(x = time_period, y = Values, fill = Values ) +
  geom_col() +
theme_light() +

theme(text = element_text(size = 14)) +
labs(
    x = "Time Period",
    y = "Sum of Observed Values",
title = "Bar Chart of Time Period vs Sum of Observed Values"
  )

print(bar_chart_plot)
```

# Scatter Plot with Linear Regression: Countrywise Correlation between GNI(Gross National Income) and Time Period
The third visualization uses the combination of the two dataset files- unicef_indicator_1.csv and unicef_metadata.csv displaying a scatter plot with linear regression showing the global correlation between the GNI and the year over the time period from 1960 to 2020.


```{r}
unicef_filtered_data_based_on_sex <- filter(unicef_indicator_1, sex == "Total")
unicef_selected_data_from_filtered_data <- unicef_filtered_data_based_on_sex %>%
select(country, time_period, obs_value, sex)
 
unicef_metadata_selected_data <- unicef_metadata %>%
select(country, time_period = year, `GNI (current US$)`, `Life expectancy at birth, total (years)`, `Population, total`)

manual_full_joined_data <- full_join(unicef_selected_data_from_filtered_data, unicef_metadata_selected_data, by = c("time_period", "country"))

scatter_plot <- ggplot(data = manual_full_joined_data) +
  aes(x = time_period, y = `GNI (current US$)`, colour = country) +
  geom_point() +
geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    x = "Time Period",
    y = "Gross National Income(GNI)",
    title = "Countrywise GNI vs Time Period"
  ) +
theme_minimal() +
theme(text = element_text(size = 14))+
 theme(legend.position="none")

print(scatter_plot)
```

# Time Series Plot: Countrywise changes in total population from 1960 to 2020
The fourth visualization is a time series plot that uses the dataset file- unicef_metadata.csv and shows how the total population of each country have changed over time from 1960 to 2020. As per the time series plot, ***China*** has the largest population over this time period followed by ***India***.
```{r}
time_series_plot <- ggplot(data = unicef_metadata) +
  aes(x = year, y = `Population, total`, color = country) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Population",
    title = "Global changes in total population over time"
  ) +
theme_grey() +
theme(text = element_text(size = 14))+
  guides(color ="none")

print(time_series_plot)
```
